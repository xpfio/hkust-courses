## ECON 4999M - Housing Economics (4 units)
Housing, unlike other goods, has its unique characteristics in terms of heterogeneity, durability, spatial fixity, and high purchase price relative to income. These suggest that conventional economic concepts need to be readdressed in order to analyze the microeconomic issues of housing. Besides, a significant number of households own residential properties by borrowing mortgages. A substantial collapse in housing prices might lead to negative equity for those households, and reduce their consumption and investment thereafter. Therefore, the macroeconomic implication of housing market dynamics cannot be overstated. The US subprime mortgage crisis during 2007-09 suggests that a sharp downturn in the housing market can cause negative spillovers to the aggregate economy. The first part of this course focuses on microeconomic issues like housing demand and supply analysis, models of housing market, rationales and effects of government’s housing policies. The second part emphasizes the macroeconomic issues such as the stylized facts on housing market dynamics, causes of housing market fluctuations, and housing market spillovers.

## MGMT 6520O - Achieving Team High Performance (2 units)
This course will introduce students to the fundamental dynamics that drive successful team performance. Today in whatever organization we work in we are expected to work in a team structure. In some cases we work in teams that meet face to face, in others we need to work with people who we may never meet physically and only over the phone or video. In both situations understanding what drives effective collaboration and performance is critical. Unfortunately few leaders and organisations are well-prepared to lead or to participate well in teams. This is due to a combination of factors related to the way people are used to interacting with each other in groups, cultural differences, personality diversity and emotional needs. This course will cover all of those areas using a mix of the latest management theory on team performance, Harvard case studies and online simulations, competitive experiential group exercises, classroom discussions and individual personality assessments. Students completing this course will not only learn substantially about team leadership but also about how to develop their own capabilities as future leaders

Part 1 of the course is coordinated by the School; and Part 2 consists of some department-specific workshops which are coordinated by the department. Graded PP, P or F.

## PHYS 6810F - Modern AMO (Atomic Molecular Optical) Physics with Atoms and Photons (3 units)

Introduction to modern atomic physics with ultracold atoms and photons. The basic theoretical tools for atom optics and quantum optics will be introduced. Basic topics include atom-light interactions, cooling and trapping neutral and charged atoms and molecules, degenerate quantum gases, quantum manipulation and detection of atomic states, ultracold collisions and others which provide the foundations for contemporary research in AMO physics. Recent research works will be also covered including many-body states in optical lattices and synthetic topological states in ultracold atoms.

## PHYS 6810G - Computational Energy Materials and Simulations (3 units)

This course introduces atomistic computational methods to model, understand, and predict the properties and behavior of real materials, including solids, liquids, and nanostructures. Their application to sustainable energy will be discussed. Specific topics include: density-functional theory (DFT), Kohn-Sham equations, local and semi-local density approximations and hybrid functionals, basis sets, pseudopotentials; Hartree-Fock method; ab initio molecular dynamics with interatomic interactions derived on the fly from DFT, Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics;  Monte-Carlo sampling; computational spectroscopy from first principles, IR and Raman. The students will learn how to use free open-source packages to do materials simulations on a Linux computer cluster. The students should have basic knowledge of quantum mechanics.

## PHYS 6990 - MPhil Thesis Research (0 units)

Master's thesis research supervised by a faculty member.  A successful defense of the thesis leads to the grade Pass.  No course credit is assigned.

## PHYS 7990 - Doctoral Thesis Research (0 units)
